							A regular ticket is one that is in your hand, or will be mailed by the Burning Man Organization.

						<p> 
							A Will Call ticket is going to be held for you At the festival at the Will Call building and will 
							prevent you from being on early team. We firmly suggest that EVERYONE (not just early team) NOT have 
							their ticket held at Will Call as it WILL add hours to the amount of time spent waiting in line to enter the festival.
						</p>
						<p>
							Financial assistance may be available to those with Low Income tickets.
